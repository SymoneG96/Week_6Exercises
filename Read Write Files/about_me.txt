Hello, my name is Symone Gant.
I was born and raised in the city of Chicago.
I had one pet growning up name Ceaser. I totally forgot what breed he was sorry!
If i could travel anywhere for a week I would go to Columbia or Switzerland.
If I could live anywhere in the world for a YEAR I would live in Canada or Morocco.

If I could do anything for my 'perfect' night out, I would go to a cozy jazz club in New York City with friends. 
We would enjoy live music, delicious food, and great conversation!
